# What this is
These are my bash configuration files.

My `~/.bashrc` simply sources `~/.bash/bashrc` which again sources all other relevant files.

See `bashrc` for a brief explenation of what each file contains, or the files to see for your self.

# Note
If you spot something that is solved sub-optimally or down right dumb, please let me know by opening an issue.
