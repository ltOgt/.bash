# What this is
These are my bash configuration files.

My `~/.bashrc` simply sources `~/.bash/bashrc` which again sources all other relevant files.

See `bashrc` for a brief explenation of what each file contains, or the files to see for your self.

# Dependencies
Since this is my personal bash setup, there exist multiple dependencies to other programms that I have installed on my machines.
To use this bash setup either install the programms or remove the corresponding lines.

`bashrc` uses
- `urxvt_zoom` (custom script to change urxvt font-size)

`compounds.bash` uses 
- `rsvg-convert`
- `trans` (https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell)
- `wn` (wordnet)

`exports.bash` uses
- `vim`

`git.bash` uses
- `git`

`shorthands.bash` uses
- `zathura` (pdf reader)
- `cvlc` (vlc media player)
- `sxiv`
- `jupyter-lab`
- `chromium-browser`
- `network-manager`
- `nmcli`
- `urxvt_zoom` (custom script to change urxvt font-size)
